1. Data Processing and Feature Engineering:
The notebook imports various libraries, including pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, and gensim, indicating an emphasis on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.
It loads a dataset (talent.csv), which likely contains candidate profiles.
Text processing steps include:
Stopword removal (nltk.corpus.stopwords)
Lemmatization (WordNetLemmatizer)
Tokenization (word_tokenize, sent_tokenize)
Regex-based text cleaning
2. Ranking Algorithm and Candidate Evaluation:
The presence of KMeans, TfidfVectorizer, and Word2Vec suggests semantic analysis and clustering of candidate profiles.
cosine_similarity appears multiple times, likely used to rank candidates based on text similarity (e.g., resume vs. job description matching).
The use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) suggests a scoring mechanism for ranking candidates.
3. Initial Filtering of Candidates:
Some key indicators for filtering candidates before ranking:
Text vectorization and similarity: TfidfVectorizer + cosine_similarity
KMeans clustering: Helps group candidates into relevant vs. irrelevant categories
Word2Vec model: Assesses semantic meaning to identify closely matched candidates
4. Evaluating Improvement Over Multiple Starring Actions: 
If a candidate is "starred," their ranking score might be boosted through:
Weighted ranking adjustments based on past selections
Supervised learning models (e.g., SVR) to learn from previous human selections
Re-training the ranking system dynamically with feedback
